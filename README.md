# District Summary
Includes the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


# School Summary
Includes the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


# Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Saved the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".


# Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

Saved the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".


# Math Scores by Grade
Performed the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


# Reading Scores by Grade
Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


# Scores by School Spending
Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Use the code provided below to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.

Used the scores above to create a DataFrame called spending_summary.

Included the following metrics in the table:

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


# Scores by School Size
Created a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

# Scores by School Type
Used the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.

This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".

# Analysis
The overall analysis is provided at the top of the code.
